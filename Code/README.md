## Project Description
The project aimed at predicting users' daily activities using data collected from multiple sensors in smartphones. By analyzing the sensor data, the system provides insights into users' behavior patterns and predicts their activities throughout the day.
The project involves a series of steps to process the collected data and generate accurate predictions. These steps include data sampling, filtering, event triggering, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. The entire project is implemented in MATLAB, with all the necessary functions organized within the Functions folder.

To request access to the Data, Train, and Test folders, please send me an email, and I will be glad to provide you with a link that includes all the files.
