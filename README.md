# Predicting Users' Daily Activities using Smartphone Sensor Data üì±üèÉ
This repository showcases a project that focuses on predicting users' daily activities using data collected from multiple sensors in smartphones. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze the sensor data, provide insights into users' behavior patterns, and predict their level of activity at each day.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to leverage the rich sensors data available on smartphones to gain insights into users' daily activities. By analyzing this data, the project aims to predict the level of activity performed each day by users. This prediction can provide valuable information for applications in health monitoring, behavior analysis, and personalized services.

## Implementation Details
The entire project is implemented in MATLAB. The MATLAB code is structured and organized within the repository's folder structure, with the necessary functions and scripts contained in the Functions folder.

To ensure accurate activity prediction, the project follows a systematic approach that consists of several key steps. These steps include data sampling, filtering, event triggering, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification.

The first step is data sampling, where sensors data from smartphones are collected to capture the users' movements and behavior over long period of time. This raw data is then processed using filtering techniques to remove noise, artifacts, and irrelevant information.

Event triggering mechanisms are employed to detect specific patterns or transitions within the processed data. These triggers help in segmenting the data into meaningful units corresponding to different activities. This segmentation is crucial for subsequent analysis and prediction.

Feature extraction techniques are then applied to the segmented data to extract meaningful information. Various time-domain and frequency-domain features are computed from each sensor. Additionally, feature selection methods are employed to identify the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction accuracy.

Finally, the processed data, along with the extracted features, are used to train a classification model.
